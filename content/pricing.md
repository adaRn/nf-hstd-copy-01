          Absolutely yes. Please [speak to our sales](/contact) to get to know
          what kind of rates we could offer to you.
        question: I have more than 500 devices. Can I migrate to your service?
      - answer: Of course. We issue EU VAT invoices.
        question: Do you issue invoices?
      - answer: >-
          We currently offer Unifi system only at this point, but by the end of
          this year we will also support  Ubiquiti Network Management System as
          well.
        question: Do you also host UNMS?
      - answer: >-
          It's just one month. If you decide you're still better off hosting
          UniFi on your own, you don't lose anything. But trust us, you won't
          decide it.
        question: Whar's the minimum commitment?
