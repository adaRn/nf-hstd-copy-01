Like many of our customers,  we are SMB business owners and IT providers. We love Ubiquiti products. We are amazed by how easy to use they are. **We were fed up with how difficult it is to get it up and running.**

After setting up more and more UniFi products, it felt to us that deploying Cloud Keys for every of our customers' sites is simply too expensive and cumbersome to manage. We would set up our own UniFi controller, but it is simply too difficult and time consuming.

We've created a service we wish we had back then and we **use on our own** with 13 000 devices and counting, mostly in Western Europe. With our service, it's possible to set up **UniFi controller with a single click**. You don't have to worry about installing SSL nor backups strategies. We automate the entire process for you.

Sounds like exactly what you're looking for? [Have a look at our plans](/pricing) and get your UniFi instance up and running in a matter of minutes, not days. Oh, and did we also mention we take care of the system upgrades?
