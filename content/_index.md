          Easy and simple UniFi and UNMS hosting at solid prices. Unifi Hosted
          takes care of server and controller updates. What more could you ask
          for? Support is great too!

          I've now set up a VPS-Unlimited package and moved our four Cloud Keys
          across. It's all working beautifully!
